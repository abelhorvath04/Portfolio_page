This is the source code of my portfolio page. I work on this project each day. E.g. bugfixing, errorhandling and better design solutions are also my desired goal. 
The PHPMailer sends real e-mail message with PHP. My purpose was to practice State handling, gain experience in Redux, NPM usage, PHP writing, set up PhotoSwipe in my project.

Will be: Calculator fixed, Photo upload/download function in Gallery, ToDo design and extra features, ToDo data storing, Forum will be reachable in a subdomain.

Technique:
  - **React**
  - **JavaScript**
  - **Bootstrap**
  - **PHP**
  - **CSS**
  - **HTML**
  - **Photoswipe**
  - **React-Router-Dom**
  - **Redux**
  - **ClassNames** (JS utility)
  - **LARAVEL** (will be on the forum)
